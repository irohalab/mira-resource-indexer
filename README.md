## Start from docker

### Setup Requirements

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)

### Boot up

You can start container by:

- Start all service defined in docker-compose.yml using docker-compose up

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```
To run it in background (detached mode), just add `-d` option
```
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

- Run `main` container in bash mode

```
$ docker-compose start mongo
$ docker-compose run --no-deps --rm --service-ports main bash
node@add8121dc7c5:/irohalab/indexer$ npm run start
```

## Sentry

When deploy to test or production server. it's important to know the health of application. For example, you may need to
 know a unusual network issue caused by source sites or you may experience incorrect format of scrapped page. All of these
 information help you improve the application by analyzing data collected from error log.

Sentry is an easy to use SaaS error log collect and analytics service. We have already integrated with its SDK. all you
 need to do is registering your account and set up the environment variable SENTRY_DSN to your `dsn`. and wait for events.
